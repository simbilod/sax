# SAX

> S + Autograd + XLA

![](docs/logo.svg)

Autograd and XLA for S-parameters - a scatter parameter circuit simulator and
optimizer for the frequency domain based on [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

The simulator was developed for simulating Photonic Integrated Circuits but in fact is
able to perform any S-parameter based circuit simulation. The goal of SAX is to be a
thin wrapper around JAX with some basic tools for S-parameter based circuit simulation
and optimization. Therefore, SAX does not define any special datastructures and tries to
stay as close as possible to the functional nature of JAX. This makes it very easy to
get started with SAX as you only need functions and standard python dictionaries. Let's
dive in...

## Quick Start

[Full Quick Start page](https://flaport.github.io/sax/examples/01_quick_start.html) -
[Documentation](https://flaport.github.io/sax).

Let's first import the SAX library, along with JAX and the JAX-version of numpy:

```python
import sax
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
```

Define a model function for your component. A SAX model is just a function that returns
an 'S-dictionary'. For example a directional coupler:

```python
def coupler(coupling=0.5):
    kappa = coupling**0.5
    tau = (1-coupling)**0.5
    sdict = sax.reciprocal({
        ("in0", "out0"): tau,
        ("in0", "out1"): 1j*kappa,
        ("in1", "out0"): 1j*kappa,
        ("in1", "out1"): tau,
    })
    return sdict

coupler(coupling=0.3)
```

    {('in0', 'out0'): 0.8366600265340756,
     ('in0', 'out1'): 0.5477225575051661j,
     ('in1', 'out0'): 0.5477225575051661j,
     ('in1', 'out1'): 0.8366600265340756,
     ('out0', 'in0'): 0.8366600265340756,
     ('out1', 'in0'): 0.5477225575051661j,
     ('out0', 'in1'): 0.5477225575051661j,
     ('out1', 'in1'): 0.8366600265340756}

Or a waveguide:

```python
def waveguide(wl=1.55, wl0=1.55, neff=2.34, ng=3.4, length=10.0, loss=0.0):
    dwl = wl - wl0
    dneff_dwl = (ng - neff) / wl0
    neff = neff - dwl * dneff_dwl
    phase = 2 * jnp.pi * neff * length / wl
    amplitude = jnp.asarray(10 ** (-loss * length / 20), dtype=complex)
    transmission =  amplitude * jnp.exp(1j * phase)
    sdict = sax.reciprocal({("in0", "out0"): transmission})
    return sdict

waveguide(length=100.0)
```

    {('in0', 'out0'): 0.97953-0.2013j, ('out0', 'in0'): 0.97953-0.2013j}

These component models can then be combined into a circuit:

```python
mzi, _ = sax.circuit(
    netlist={
        "instances": {
            "lft": coupler,
            "top": waveguide,
            "rgt": coupler,
        },
        "connections": {
            "lft,out0": "rgt,in0",
            "lft,out1": "top,in0",
            "top,out0": "rgt,in1",
        },
        "ports": {
            "in0": "lft,in0",
            "in1": "lft,in1",
            "out0": "rgt,out0",
            "out1": "rgt,out1",
        },
    }
)

type(mzi)
```

    function

As you can see, the mzi we just created is just another component model function! To simulate it, call the mzi function with the (possibly nested) settings of its subcomponents. Global settings can be added to the 'root' of the circuit call and will be distributed over all subcomponents which have a parameter with the same name (e.g. 'wl'):

```python
wl = jnp.linspace(1.53, 1.57, 1000)
result = mzi(wl=wl, lft={'coupling': 0.3}, top={'length': 200.0}, rgt={'coupling': 0.8})

plt.plot(1e3*wl, jnp.abs(result['in0', 'out0'])**2, label="in0->out0")
plt.plot(1e3*wl, jnp.abs(result['in0', 'out1'])**2, label="in0->out1", ls="--")
plt.xlabel("λ [nm]")
plt.ylabel("T")
plt.grid(True)
plt.figlegend(ncol=2, loc="upper center")
plt.show()
```

## Installation

On Linux, the recommended way to install SAX is as follows:

```sh
pip install sax[jax]
```

On Windows, the recommended way to install SAX is by first setting the `PIP_FIND_LINKS`
environment variable such that the JAX dependency can be installed from a 3rd party
repository:

```cmd
set PIP_FIND_LINKS="https://whls.blob.core.windows.net/unstable/index.html"
pip install sax[jax]
```

If for whatever reason you don't want the JAX dependency, a JAX-less SAX can also be
installed (Note that this is a _minimal_ version of SAX... things might not work as
expected. Use on your own risk!):

```sh
pip install sax[nojax]
```

If you want a specific version of JAX, for example if you want a GPU-enabled version of
JAX, please read the offical JAX install instructions
[here](https://github.com/google/jax/#installation).
